    * Revert change introduced in 0.0.2 causing Twitter protocol to not try
      to reconnect to a peer if it couldn't connect the first time the plugin

    * Fix crashes in Twitter authentication.
    * Properly honor the chosen port number if a static host and port are
      marked as preferred.

    * Don't attempt to connect to unavailable Twitter peers over and over.

      tweet.

      private direct messages.
    * Display a helpful message when someone sends a normal instant message to
      the Tomahawk XMPP presence.
    * Incompatible change: Twitter SIP protocol has changed slightly. 0.0.1
      clients will not be able to talk to newer clients.
    * Don't let long playlist or summary names force a large Tomahawk window.
